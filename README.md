## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boilerlabs/docs
cd docs
```
   
2. Choose the template you need from the available directories (e.g., `README minimal`, `README detailed`, `CONTRIBUTING`, etc.).

3. Customize the templates to match your projectâ€™s needs.

## Usage

Simply copy the boilerplate files you need and modify them as per your project's details. For example, if you need a **minimal README**, copy the `README-minimal.md` file and edit the sections like title, description, and usage with your project-specific information.

```bash
cp templates/readme/minimal-1.md ./your-project/README.md
```

You can also customize the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and other available templates to ensure a consistent and professional documentation structure across your projects.
